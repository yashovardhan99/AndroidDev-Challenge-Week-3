## :scroll: Description

This is my submission for week 3 of the challenge. I took part in
the [EMEA](https://github.com/android/android-dev-challenge-compose/blob/assets/MySoothe.zip) speed
run.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
Again, I learnt a lot of new stuff here. This includes navigation (It's very easy!!) and theming. I
had never paid much attention to theming and typography and learn a lot this time.

Like, did you know Compose requires the alpha component of a color in its hex (A lot of time spent
here)
Also, a letter spacing of 1.15 actually means you need to set it as 0.115 em.
